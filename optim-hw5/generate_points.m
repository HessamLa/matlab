% This function generates a random map of all connected cities
function XY = generate_points(n, rangex, rangey)
    % n is the number of cities
    % c is the number of connections between cities
    % rangex is a 2-element array, indicating range in x axis
    % rangey is a 2-element array, indicating range in y axis
    % XY would be the array of (x,y) coordinates of each city on the map
    % PROXIMITY would be the symmetric weighted proximity matrix. If two cities are
    % connected, their corresponding element in this matrix would be the
    % distance. Initially it is set to -1
